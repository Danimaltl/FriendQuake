# FriendQuake
Do you love the Quake 1 aesthetic but wish you didn't have to blow anything to bits? Or run away from a bunch of snarling weirdos?

Currently, FriendQuake is a server-side QuakeC (ssqc) mod for Quake 1 aimed at getting all those "monsters" to behave a little nicer! You can hang out in any map you like to chat with the soldiers or pet the dogs.

This is of course somewhat inspired by:
* Mr. Friendly (Doom): https://jp.itch.io/mr-friendly
* Woof3D (Wolfenstein 3D): https://barsk.itch.io/woof3d

So far, basically nothing has been implemented so **don't jump in now!**

## Thoughts on licensing

Most Quake mod releases don't make a big deal out of this since they're released for free and are unlikely to cause a stir with rights holders. However, for a laugh I made sure to use the GPL'd version 1.01 QuakeC as a base. The commonly used 1.06 code was never released under GPL, and the "clean 1.01" code does not have a readme or any information about its changes. 

Mods that don't include the copyright/license headers, or the GPL license file might unfortunately be infringing copyright. But, whether or not that's a big deal: **QuakeC mods should note their changes, credit the original authors, and release with their source files.** It's a faux pas not to do this but with GPL it is **required!** There's a lot of good practices and readmes in place, but there should be more credit and reference to the license in the source itself.

Check out the source code of Quakespasm if you want a good example of crediting contributors within the source code.
